# Interview Task Overview

This document outlines a series of tasks given for an interview. Each task is described along with its requirements.

## Task 1: Array Filtering and Mapping

Create an array of objects representing people with properties like name, age, and gender. Write a function to filter out all females and then map the remaining people to an array of names. Print the final result.

## Task 2: Object Manipulation

Create an array of objects representing books with properties like title, author, and year. Write a function that takes the array and returns a new array with only the book titles. Print the result.

## Task 3: Function Composition

Write three functions: one to square a number, one to double a number, and one to add 5 to a number. Compose these functions to create a new function that squares a number, doubles the result, and then adds 5.

## Task 4: Sorting Objects

Create an array of objects representing cars with properties like make, model, and year. Write a function to sort the array of cars by the year of manufacture in ascending order. Print the sorted array.

## Task 5: Find and Modify

Write a function that searches an array of objects for a specific person by name. If found, modify their age property. Print the updated array.

## Task 6: Array Reduction

Create an array of numbers. Write a function that uses the reduce method to calculate the sum of all even numbers in the array.

## Task 7: Leap Year Checker

Write a function that determines whether a given year is a leap year.

## Task 8: Count Vowels

Write a function that counts the number of vowels in a given string. Example: "Happy New Year"

## Task 9: Unique Values

Create an array of numbers with some duplicate values. Write a function to filter out the duplicate values and return a new array with only unique numbers. Print the result.

## Task 10: Find Maximum Value

Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the maximum value.

## Task 11: Advanced Sorting

Create an array of objects representing students with 'name' and 'grades' properties. Write a function to sort the students by average grade in descending order.

## Task 12: Functional Programming - Reduce

Write a function that uses the reduce function to calculate the total value of an array of objects with a 'quantity' and 'price' property.

## Task 13: Array Intersection

Write a function that takes two arrays and returns a new array containing only the elements that appear in both arrays.
